summary: |
  The paper investigates the impact of different traffic light waiting times on individuals’ choice of transportation mode (e.g., bicycle, bus, car, etc.).
  The calculations of this study are based on Open Street Map (OSM) data analysed with Dijkstra’s algorithm.
  The data, code, and intermediate results have been made publicly available by the authors under permissive licenses (CC BY 4.0 and MIT).
  For the purposes of this reproducibility review, we verified the functionality of all scripts and the reported results in Figures 1-5 and in Table 2.
  The reproduced results were in accordance with the reported results and therefore the reproduction of the paper is considered successful.
